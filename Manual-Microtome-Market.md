A manual microtome driver is a device used in histology laboratories to assist in the sectioning of tissue samples for microscopic examination. The driver is specifically designed to drive a microtome, which is a cutting instrument used to produce thin slices or sections of tissue.



The driver consists of a handle or knob that can be operated manually by the user. It is typically connected to the microtome through a mechanical linkage, such as a screw mechanism or a self-lubricated cam system. The driver allows for precise control and adjustment of the cutting movement of the microtome.



When operating the manual microtome driver, the user manually turns the handle or knob in a controlled manner. This rotation movement translates into a forward or backward motion of the microtome's cutting blade. By adjusting the speed and direction of the driver, the user can control the thickness and quality of the tissue sections produced.



The manual microtome driver requires the user's skill and coordination to achieve consistent and accurate results. It is commonly used in research and diagnostic laboratories for the preparation of tissue samples for pathological examinations, immunohistochemistry, and other histological procedures.
